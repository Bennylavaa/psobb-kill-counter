# psobb-kill-counter
Addon to track statistics on number of enemies defeated in PSO:BB

This addon is based heavily on the Monster HP addon in the
[PSOBBMod-Addons](https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons) project.
Some of the scripts used for this project were taken directly from there.
Attribution for each file is provided in a header comment at the top of each
file.
