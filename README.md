# psobb-kill-counter
Addon to track statistics on number of enemies defeated in PSO:BB

This addon is based heavily on the Monster HP addon in the
[PSOBBMod-Addons](https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons) project.
Some of the scripts used for this project were taken directly from there.
Attribution for each file is provided in a header comment at the top of each file.

## Installation
This addon depends on the [dinput8.dll plugin](https://github.com/HybridEidolon/psobbaddonplugin),
provided by [HybridEidolon](https://github.com/HybridEidolon). A modified version of this dll can
be obtained from the [PSOBBMod-Addons](https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons) project,
provided by [Solybum](https://github.com/Solybum). Please refer to the PSOBBMod-Addons project for
instructions on how to obtain the dinput8.dll and where to place it.

Afterward, place the Kill Counter addon (that is, the entirety of the Kill Counter folder)
right alongside the Character Reader and Monster HP addons provided by the PSOBBMod-Addons
project, in the imgui folder.
